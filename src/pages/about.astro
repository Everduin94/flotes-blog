    <p>
Flotes is an app I created to efficiently take & study notes that work like flash cards.
    </p>
    <p>
While working on Flotes. I noticed what worked for me in a team at my full-time job, did not hold up to what worked best for me in my side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
And so I created this blog with a few ideas in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>How to create succesful side projects</li>
    <li>The difference between engineering at a large company, and independently</li>
    <li>Share things I learn along the way</li>
    <li>Announce updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Outside of programming. I live with my wonderful fiancee and our 7 pets. I am a BJJ Black Belt,  enjoy watching anime, going outside, cooking, and I've recently gotten into D&D :)

    Their currently isn't a way to comment on this blog, and Flotes is not Open Source.
