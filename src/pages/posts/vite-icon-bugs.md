## The Bug
I recently ran into an issue where **Fontawesome icons would show** for a moment, and **then disappear**. This is very difficult to debug because:
- It only happened in *production*
- Other icons were working
- It was *seemingly* random

When a Fontawesome icon is imported with a **treeshakeable** import **in multiple files**, it disppears the 2nd time the import is invoked. -- We can verify this in the network tab. Our icon is coming down as an **empty object**. 

**`ðŸ’¡Context`**  *A treeshakeable import in Fontawesome is when we import like this:*

- *import { faDiscord } from "@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons/**faDiscord**";*

![Network Icons](/network-icons.png)


## The Solution

We create a **single file** for importing icons that are used in **multiple places** in the project

<div class="file-header">
  <div class="circles">
    <div class="circle red"></div>
    <div class="circle yellow"></div>
    <div class="circle green"></div>
  </div>
  icons.ts
</div>

```typescript
import {
  definition as discord 
} from "@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons/faDiscord";
export const faDiscord =  discord
```

Now instead of importing from `@fortawesome`, we instead import from `icons.ts`

Thats it! -- I hope you find this helpful, as this was a wild goose chase for me ðŸ˜…
