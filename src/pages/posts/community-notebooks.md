## What are Community Notebooks?

Community notebooks are pre-made notebooks published by Flotes.
You can **practice these notebooks**, copy and edit them, **share them with friends** (link does not require login), or use them as **inspiration for your own notebooks**

The first community notebook is [**Tailwind CSS Grid**](https://flotes.app/home/community/tailwind-css-grid). This is a topic that I constantly found myself **reaching for the docs** to **recall classes** and what they did.

These notes helped saved me time and learn the naunce and tricky parts of Tailwind. They also contain references to the documentation and have various examples.

Even if you have no interest in **Tailwind** (it's very polarizing ðŸ˜¬), you can still see how this notebook is **structured and formatted** to make an **effective and challenging notebook**
